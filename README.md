# FAQChatbot
## The Team
We are students from Olin College of Engineering.
  
This project was done as part of a year-long senior capstone class called SCOPE.

## The Goal

Volunteers resort to emailing coordinators when they are not able to find the information they need. Lots of volunteers. Repetitive questions. Roadblock for both volunteers and coordinators.  
  
A chatbot programmed with answers to general, reoccurring questions from volunteers can offload the burden of crafting individual replies that is placed on coordinators.  
  
Twilio's Autopilot platform offers an automated chatbot that can provide answers to tedious volunteer questions immediately and in turn reduces the workload of the coordinators.
